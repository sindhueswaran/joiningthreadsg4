## Joining threads
## Joining lives

#### Encouraging creativity empowers and strengthens our resourcefulness and talent, availing possibilities to improve livelihoods. We share craft skills with women and children in projects located in North India.


### What we do 

##### Women Skill Building
We work with womens groups sharing knitting, crochet, felting and sewing techniques through workshops for NGOs in New Delhi, Rajasthan and Uttarakhand. 


##### Education
We offer teacher trainings and workshop-classes with children and youth using arts and crafts to facilitate various ways of learning through activities in the classroom.

##### Encouraging wealth for women
We intend to link groups within our network who can purchase the products that will directly earn money for the women. For e.g. Atma Seva buys felted hot water bottle covers and knitted hand warmers and La Volotte in Germany bought cloth bags and felted buttons from Jan Madhyam. We also aim to encourage the women to form small co-operatives who can learn how to setup local outlets to sell their crafts independently.
